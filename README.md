# Pygame Othello for Capstone Project

## What is this?
A Pygame implementation of the game Othello. We made this and added several
features to support researching purposes.

Aside from playing Othello, this program is also capable of recording and
replaying games.
<br>
<br>

## Getting started
Get this on your machine by putting this in Git Bash
```
git clone https://github.com/brandon-mai/Capstone-AI-Othello.git
```
Then install by heading to the repo folder and running this in Terminal
```
pip install -q -r requirements.txt
```
Final thing
```
python main.py
```
<br>
<br>

## Basic adjustments
The game menu is pretty self-explanatory.
- Play: where you play. Select the game mode, whether you want to record the game,
then AI's evaluating function and depth (if needed).
- Replay: replay recorded games. You can navigate through moves with left and right
arrow keys.
- UI Settings: UI settings. Toggle "I'm feeling lucky" on if you want random (bad)
board designs.

<br>

## Advanced adjustments
Head to `heuristics.py` and add your own heuristics / evaluating functions!

In accordance with the indicated guidelines at the beginning of the file, of course.
